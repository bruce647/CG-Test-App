# vue3-project

Development Process: 
1.Create the Vue project with command 'vue create project-name'
2.Install Vuex as a state management tool
3.Fetch Data from json file and store data in store.js
4.Let the component invoke the data from store.js to see if it can be displayed successfully
5.Finish the layout of each component with CSS
  
Personally, I didn't find the test tough.I completed the front end in around 6 hours and  the UI was the most time-consuming part of the front end. I could really accomplish it lot faster if I didn't bother about global state management. However, I wanted to make the project more maintainable and demonstrate my knowledge of how to build a project, so I introduced Vuex.
  
Tools used:
Javascripy framework: Vue3, I assumed you'd require a Vue-skilled individual based on the job description, therefore I utilised Vue as a framework.
State Management: Vuex, It's popular and easy to maintain
UI framework: Element plus, Reduce development time and improve efficiency
Ajax call: Axios
CLI: Vue cli, Stable and popular, suitable for most browsers
